# BaseProjectApp
A base app for CS370 projects.

Fork this repository to collaborate with your group (you don't have write access here).


## Fork the Repository
A [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) is a copy of a repository. 
> Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.  
> Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project that you don't have access to
> or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.
You can fork to your own personal Github userspace, or create an organization for your team and fork it there.

### _Optional:_ Creating an organization
An organization is a convenient way of controlling multiple people's access
to a repository or group of repositories. You are already a part of the `SSU-CS370-F18`
organization. Follow the link below for instructions on creating an organization just 
for your project team.  
- [Creating Organizations](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch/)

You can instead have one person fork to their personal account, and they
will add the rest of your team as collaborators.


### Forking a Repository
1. Navigate to this project's repository **on GitHub.com** (you probably are already here!)
1. Click the `Fork` button at the top of this page
1. Choose where you want to fork the repository to. This may be your personal GitHub
space, or if you've followed the instructions above to create an organization for 
your team it should show up here

You're done!  
Your fork now has its own space in GitHub.
You can now clone it and do all your work with no worry of affecting the original 
`BaseProjectApp` in any way. If the original "upstream" repository gets updated, it 
is possible to update your fork with those changes (does not happen automatically).


### Making the project yours
Now that you've created a fork and have your own separate version 
of this project, you may wish to make some changes:
- [Rename the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/renaming-a-repository/)
- Rename your application
    1. open Project side panel
    2. un-check the `compact empty middle packages` option
    3. expand the package folders (`app/java/ssu/groupname/baseapplication`)
    4. refactor->rename the `groupname` package to your group's name
        - choose `rename package`
        - select `search in comments` and `search in strings`
    5. refactor->rename the `baseapplication` package to your project name
- Change this readme!! Replace all this with information about your own project
    - any setup required (other than cloning)
    - rules on contributing (what branches to use, etc.)
    - how to use the app!
