Eyass_Security_Camera_App-Get_Camera_Feed is the backend of the project with all the hard logic to grab a live stream from the hls url (in my case the hls url was obtained by using a python script to grab the .m3u8 video url of a live twitch stream).

Eyass_Security_Camera_App-master is the front end of the android app project that deals with the gui and functionality of the buttons, hamburger menu, login, etc.
